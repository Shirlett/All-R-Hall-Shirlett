Description: This package contains two functions that formats numbers and returns them as characters.
    They are especially useful for axes labels when the user needs a simple function that does not require
    as many arguments as format or prettyNum. The addpercent() allows the user to format a number as 
    a percentage and specifying the number of decimal places is optional. The second function, signifDigit() allows 
    the user to view significant figures in a given value without losing digits to the left of a decimal place.
