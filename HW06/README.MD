# Reflection
This homework was both extremely complicated and exhausting. I could probably provide a list of a hundred tasks that required intense concentration and extensive research for resolution. Although the first section dealing with regular expressions did not pose as much difficulty, it was very long and took time away from solving the more challenging tasks. This portion was also supported by viewing the work from other githb users jarnold and siskavera. 

I used the leaflet package to generate an HTML widget that illustrates the origination of singers against a geographic map. The install was successful and seemed to work within the Rstudio however, rendering the markdown to github output caused the widget to disappear. I was finally able to resolve it by installing the github version for leaflet as devtools::install_github("rstudio/leaflet"). These also needed preinstallation of the htmltools and scales libraries.

Another area of major difficulty was related to retrieval of the reverse geographic codes from the Google Map API. This required a vector pair fed to revgeocode() within a map function to work successfully. Initially, due to limited experience with the map function, I did not use the two fuctions correctly and it consistently failed until I used map2. After many trials, I also ran into another problem because I was not aware of Google's 2500 daily limit on API requests. I had to move on to another section of the homework until the 24 hours passed. The output of map2 is a list and the resulting addresses were dataframe objects with a list class. I was not sure how to split this to obtain the city from these nested objects and attempted to convert to tibble and to unlist the columns. However, the unnest function was able to split the nested list across additional columns.

In order to capture potential error messages from Google that cannot be nested and unnested, I explored the use of map's supporting functions, possibly() and safely(). However, I was not able to create the same data type objects generated by the API with the default value within these functions so that they could also be unnested.

I learned a lot from this exercise, such as regular expressions, creating functions, and mapping over elements one at a time and I enjoyed the process of cleaning the data from the candy dataset. Since this homework covers so many new and complex concepts, it would have been nice to have more time to complete the other optional exercises in this homework set.
