#1.String Instruments from http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html
##14.2.5 - String Basics
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1.
#Paste prints strings and leaves a space separator by default
(pst<-paste("Tom", "Dick", "Harry", NA)) 

#Paste0 prints strings and omits the space between the strings
(pst0<-paste0("Tom", "Dick", "Harry", NA)) 

#Both paste and paste0 are roughly equivalent to the str_c but paste0 more closely replicates 

#the  str_c function
(strc <- str_c("Tom", "Dick", "Harry", NA)) 

#Paste functions treat NA as they would any other string and prints NA, whereas str_c sees it as

#missing data that has to be replaced


#2.The sep arguement is an indication of the string to insert between vectors whereas collapse

#is an indication of the string that should be used to combine vectors into a single string.
str_c("a","b", c("c","d"), sep = " ", collapse = ",")
str_c("a","b", c("c","d"), sep = " ")


#3.Using str_length and str_sub to extract a middle character(s) whether the length of the

#string is odd or even

#Function to test the length of a given string
my_string <- function(x) {
if((str_length(x) %% 2) == 0) {
    str_sub(x, (str_length(x)/2), ((str_length(x)/2)+1))
} else {
    str_sub(x, ((str_length(x)+1)/2), ((str_length(x)+1)/2))
}
}

my_string("middle")
my_string("tower")


#4.
str_wrap("str_wrap can be used to format paragraphs by controlling the width and indentation. This is useful for printing long paragraphs", width=60)

#5.str_trim removes whitespace to the left or right of strings. Its counterpart 

#is str_pad() which adds whitespace.

#6.Convert a vector of strings into a single string and consider less than optimal vector

#lengths, such as two, one or zero

x = c("a", "b", "c")
y = c("a", "b")
z = c("a")
alpha = c("")

#Function to test the length of vector and modify format of the output accordingly
my_conversion <- function(vec) {
  converted <- ""
  if (length(vec) < 2)
  {
    converted <- str_c(vec)
  }
  else if (length(vec) == 2)
  {
    converted <- str_c(converted, vec[1], " and ", vec[2])
  }
  else
  {
    for (i in 1:(length(vec)-2))
    {
      converted <- str_c(converted, vec[i], ", ")
    }
    converted <- str_c(converted, vec[length(vec)-1], ", and ", vec[length(vec)])

##14.3.1.1 - Basic Matches
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#1. Explanation of why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\".

#"\" indicates an escape from prior text

#"\\" indicates the creation of a regular expression and be recognized as \

#"\\\" indicates that the backslash character needs to be matched


#2. Matching the sequence "'\

test<- "\"'\\"
#str_view(test, "\\\"'\\\\")

#3. Patterns matched by the regular expression \..\..\.

test2 <- "covers.x.y.z"
#str_view(test2, "\\..\\..\\..")
#Patterns that are a dot followed by any character, three consecutive times

```


##14.3.2.1 - Anchors
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1. Match the literal string "$^$"
test3<- "goodness$^$gracious"
#str_view(test3, "\\$\\^\\$")

#2. Regular Expressions to match common words in stringr::words:
#that start with y
#str_view(words, "^y", match = TRUE)

#that end with x
#str_view(words, "x$", match = TRUE)

#are exactly three letters long
#str_view(words, "^...$", match = TRUE)

#have seven letters or more
#str_view(words, ".......", match = TRUE)

```


##14.3.3.1 - Character Classes and Alternatives
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#1. Regular expressions to find words that:
#Start with a vowel
#str_view(words, "^[aeouiy]", match = TRUE)

#Only contain consonants
#str_view(words, "^[^aeouiy]*$", match = TRUE)

#End with ed but not with eed
#str_view(words, "[^e]ed$", match = TRUE)

#End with ing or ise
#str_view(words, "i(ng|se)$", match = TRUE)


#2.Verify the rule “i before e except after c”
#Well e comes before i in weigh
#str_view(words, "([^c])ei", match = TRUE)


#3. Verify that q is always followed by a u
#C'est vrai
#str_view(words, "q[^u]", match = TRUE)


#4. An expression that finds a word from British vs American English
#str_view(words, "[a-z][a-z]our$", match = TRUE)

#5. An expression that finds a string that will match phone numbers as written in Jamaica
phone <- (c("1876-928-4712", "186-748-422"))
#str_view(phone, "1876-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d", match = TRUE)

```


##14.3.4.1 - Repetition
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1. Equivalents in {m,n} form of the following:
#? - zero or one instance is equivalent to:
#{,n}: match one at most

#+ - one or more repeats is equivalent to:
#{n,}: n or more 


#* - zero or more repeats is only roughly equivalent to:
#{,m}: at most m


#2. Description of matches to the following regular expressions:
#^.*$ - This would match any length or any character
#"\\{.+\\}" - This would match at least one character
#\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} - This would match 4 repeated digits- 2 repeated digits - two repeated digits
# "\\\\{4}" - This would match \\\\


#3. Regular expressions to find words that:
#Start with three consonants.
#str_view(words, "^[^aeouiy]{3}", match = TRUE)

#Have three or more vowels in a row.
#str_view(words, "[aeouiy]{3,}", match = TRUE)

#Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.
#str_view(words, "([aeouiy][^aeouiy]){2,}", match = TRUE)



```

##14.3.5.1 - Grouping and Backreferences
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1. Description of the matches to the following:
#(.)\1\1 - Matches any single characters that repeat three times
test4 = "ssstreat"
#str_view(test4, "(.)\\1\\1", match = TRUE)

#"(.)(.)\\2\\1" - matches any single non repeating character then a character that repeats 

#twice then the same first character
test5 = "abbacadabra"
#str_view(test5, "(.)(.)\\2\\1", match = TRUE)

#(..)\1 - Find repeated pair of letters
test6 = "cucumber" 
#str_view(test6, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)

#"(.).\\1.\\1" - Match one character then any single character, then the same first character,
#then any single character, then another repeat of the first character
test7 = "tatet"
#str_view(test7, "(.).\\1.\\1", match = TRUE)

#"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1" - Match 2-3 single characters, 0 or more random characters, then the 
#same first 2-3 characters in reverse
test8 = "abctatetcba"
#str_view(test8, "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1", match = TRUE)


#2. Regular expressions to match words that:

#Start and end with the same character.
#str_view(words, "^(.).*\\1$", match = T)

#Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. “church” contains “ch” repeated twice.)
#str_view(words, "(..).*\\1", match = T)

#Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. “eleven” contains three “e”s.)
#str_view(words, "(.).*\\1.*\\1", match = T)

```

##14.4.2 - Detect Matches
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1. Using Regular expressions and str_detect:
#Words that start or end with x
#str_view(words, "^x|x$", match = TRUE)
start_with_x = str_detect(words, "^x")
end_with_x = str_detect(words, "x$")
words[start_with_x | end_with_x]

#Words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant
#str_view(words, "^[aeuioy].*[^aeuioy]$", match = TRUE)
start_with_vowel = str_detect(words, "^[aeuioy]")
end_with_consonant = str_detect(words, "[^aeuioy]$")
words[start_with_vowel & end_with_consonant]


#Words that contain at least one of each different vowel yields no results
a = str_detect(words, "a+")
e = str_detect(words, "e+")
i = str_detect(words, "i+")
o = str_detect(words, "o+")
u = str_detect(words, "u+")
y = str_detect(words, "y+")
words[a & e & i & o & u & y]



#Words that have the highest proportion of vowels
count_of_vowels = str_count(words, "[aeouiy]")
word_length = str_length(words)
prop_table <- tibble(words = words, counts = count_of_vowels, length = word_length)


prop_table %>%
  mutate(proportion = counts / length) %>%
  arrange(desc(proportion)) %>%
	head(20)



```

##14.4.3.1 - Extract Matches
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1. Correct the match to flickered

#color_list <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
#color_to_match <- str_c(color_list, collapse = "|")
#truecolors <- str_c("\\b(", str_c(color_list, collapse = "|"), ")\\b")## add boundaries 
#more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, color_to_match) > 1]
#str_view_all(more, truecolors, match = TRUE)


#Using Harvard sentences data, extract:
#The first word from each sentence
str_extract(sentences, "[a-zA-X]+") %>% head(20)

#All words ending in ing
ending <- str_subset(sentences, "\\b[A-Za-z]+ing\\b")
str_extract(ending, "\\b[A-Za-z]+ing\\b") %>% str_sub(1, -1) %>% head(10)



#All plurals
#Plurals that end in es are not captured by regex that I can fathom
#The following retrieves words that end in s and excludes 2 and 3 letter words, like has & is
unique(unlist(str_extract_all(sentences, "\\b[A-Za-z]{3,}s\\b"))) %>%
  head(20)


```

##14.4.4.1 - Grouped Matches
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1. Find words that come after a number
#Pulls out both number name and word
nw <- "(one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten) +(\\S+)"
sentences[str_detect(sentences, nw)] %>%
  str_extract(nw)

#2. To find contractions
contracted_words <- "([A-Za-z]+)'([A-Za-z]+)"
sentences %>%
  `[`(str_detect(sentences, contracted_words)) %>%
  str_extract(contracted_words)

```

##14.4.5.1- Replacing Matches
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1. Replace forward slash with backward slash
replace_for <- str_replace("How to replace a / with a backslash", "/", "\\\\")  
  								
replace_for

#2. Implement a simple version of str_to_lower() using replace_all().

phrase="aLL over tHe pLaCe"
new_phrase <- str_replace_all(phrase, c("L" = "l", "C" = "c", "H" = "h"))
new_phrase

#3. Switch the first and last letters in words and count the number of legitimate words

switch<- str_replace(words,"(^.)(.*)(.$)", "\\3\\2\\1")
still_words <- intersect(words, switch)
length(still_words)

```

##14.4.6.1 - Splitting
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1. split apples, pears, and bananas into individual components
fruits <- c("apples, pears, and bananas")
str_split(fruits, ", +(and +)?")[[1]]


#2. It is better to split by boundary on words because it considers punctuation instead of just whitespace

#3. Result of splitting with an empty string causes words to split apart
str_split("so_very ver y tired!", "")[[1]]

```

##14.5.1 - Other Patterns
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1.One could find all strings containing \ with regex() vs. with fixed() by adding the fixed
#argument to the string function
str_subset(c("stop\\", "please"), "\\\\")

str_subset(c("stop\\", "please"), fixed("\\"))

#2. Five most common words in sentences
str_extract_all(sentences, boundary("word")) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  str_to_lower() %>%
  tibble() %>%
  set_names("word") %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  count() %>%
	arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(5)

```

##14.7.1 - Stringi
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#1.
#stringi function that counts the number of words is stri_count words
#Stringi function that finds duplicated strings is stri_duplicated
#Stringi function to generate random text is stri_rand_

#2. To control the language that stri_sort() uses for sorting, one has to change the 
#value within the function related to opts_collator from NULL or ""
