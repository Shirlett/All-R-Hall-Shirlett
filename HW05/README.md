# Reflection
This homework represents a culmination of many topics covered in class and additional concepts from other sources such as Stack Overflow and documentation from cheatsheets and the forcats package. The link to the forcats package can be found here:https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forcats/forcats.pdf

Overall, the homework was extremely exhaustive but not completely difficult. There are still some lingering areas of frustration that I still have not been able to resolve such as retaining the caption on kable tables with using the "html" format. Including that specific format seems to force subsequent r chunks to appear in an html format when viewed in github. 

I am also not sure whether the pdf graphics device just simply cannot be shown in github. When viewed separately in the browser, the resulting chart does appear as intended. The link to the pdf file can be found here ![here](https://github.com/Shirlett/STAT545-hw-Hall-Shirlett/blob/master/HW05/img/long_live_plot_pdf.pdf).

Creating a link to a specific section in the markdown file from the lead Readme was also a bit trickier than anticipated since I was not sure how to incorporate the anchor in the link. This was finally resolved by looking at the page source of the .md file.
